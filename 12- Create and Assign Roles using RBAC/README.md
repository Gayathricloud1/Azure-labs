# üîê Azure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) ‚Äì Full Lab Guide

## üéØ Objective
This lab demonstrates how to use **Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to:
1. Assign built-in roles to users/groups
2. Assign roles at specific scopes (like a single VM or storage account)
3. Create and assign a **custom role** with specific permissions

---

## üìò What is RBAC?

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** is a system that helps you manage **who can access what** in Azure and what actions they can perform. It uses **roles** assigned to **principals (users, groups, or apps)** at a defined **scope** (subscription, resource group, or individual resource).

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Role                | A set of permissions (e.g., read, write, delete)                            |
| Security Principal  | A user, group, service principal, or managed identity                       |
| Scope               | The level at which the role is applied: subscription, resource group, resource |
| Role Assignment     | Binds a role to a user/group/app at a specific scope                        |

| Part | Topic                                | Description                                      |
|------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Assign Built-in Role                 | Assign a role like Reader or Contributor         |
| 2    | Assign Role at Resource Scope        | Assign permissions to a specific VM or resource  |
| 3    | Create and Assign Custom Role        | Define and use a role with custom permissions    |

## ‚úÖ Part 1: Assign a Built-in Role (e.g., Reader)

### Scenario:
Give a user read-only access to a resource group named `Dev-RG`.

### Steps:
1. Go to the **Azure Portal**
2. Search and open **Resource Groups**
3. Select or create a resource group named `Dev-RG`
4. Click **Access control (IAM)** ‚Üí **+ Add ‚Üí Add role assignment**
5. Role: Choose `Reader`
6. Assign access to: **User, group, or service principal**
7. Select user: e.g., `devuser@yourdomain.com`
8. Click **Review + assign**

üü¢ **Result**: The user can view all resources in `Dev-RG` but cannot modify or delete them.

## ‚úÖ Part 2: Assign Role at Resource Scope (e.g., VM only)

### Scenario:
Allow a developer to **start/stop a VM**, but not delete or access anything else.

### Steps:
1. Go to **Virtual Machines** in Azure Portal
2. Select the VM (e.g., `Dev-VM01`)
3. Click **Access control (IAM)** ‚Üí **+ Add ‚Üí Add role assignment**
4. Role: Choose `Virtual Machine Contributor`
5. Select user: e.g., `devuser@yourdomain.com`
6. Click **Review + assign**

üü¢ **Result**: The user can manage VM operations like start, restart, shutdown, but cannot delete or manage storage/network.

### üìå Why Use Resource-Level Scope?
- To give **fine-grained control**
- Prevent unintended access to other resources

---

## ‚úÖ Part 3: Create and Assign a Custom Role

### Scenario:
You want a user to:
- Read **blob data** from storage
- **Edit tags** on resources
- But **not delete or manage other settings**

---

### üî® Step 1: Define the Custom Role
1. Search and open **Subscriptions** ‚Üí select your subscription
2. Go to **Access control (IAM)** ‚Üí click **Roles** tab
3. Click **+ Add ‚Üí Add custom role**
4. Provide:
   - **Name**: `Blob Reader + Tag Editor`
   - **Description**: Read blob data and edit tags

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Add Permissions
1. Click **Permissions ‚Üí + Add permissions**
2. Add:
   - `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers/read`
   - `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action`
   - `Microsoft.Resources/tags/write`

---

### üìç Step 3: Assignable Scopes
1. Choose where the role can be used:
   - Subscription (global)
   - Resource Group (e.g., `Dev-RG`)

Click **Review + Create** to save the custom role.

---

### üéØ Step 4: Assign the Custom Role
1. Navigate to the **scope** (e.g., `Dev-RG`)
2. Go to **Access control (IAM)** ‚Üí **+ Add role assignment**
3. Choose `Blob Reader + Tag Editor`
4. Select user ‚Üí Click **Review + assign**

üü¢ **Result**: The user can view blobs and update tags, but not manage or delete resources.

## üõ°Ô∏è RBAC Best Practices

- üîê Use **least privilege** principle
- üéØ Assign roles at **resource group level** unless broader access is required
- üìã Review assignments regularly using **Azure Monitor** or **Access Reviews**
- üõ†Ô∏è Prefer **Azure AD Groups** for assigning access instead of individuals
- üïê Use **PIM (Privileged Identity Management)** for temporary elevation
